This guide is designed for brand new installs. It can work for existing installs, but I haven't tested it for that situation.

Осуществляем сброс пароля администратора в Windows XP, используя консольную утилиту Offline NT Password & Registry Editor при загрузке со съемного носителя. I have lots of fully-patched Windows 10 machines with nothing except for Office 2013/2016, Google Chrome, and occasionally Skype and Dropbox installed, and yet the MaxFocus/MSPRMM (what's the current name?) vulnerability scan detects a huge number of vulnerabilities on each one. Some of these vulnerabilities were patched a year or two ago. Is this a bug in the vulnerability scan? If not, how do I resolve this? I have clients asking why their weekly email reports mention a large number of vulnera. Еще одна очень полезная фишка от Sysinternals, которая позволяет облегчить жизнь системному администратору.

I use Prey ( to keep track of my laptop and other devices, and if my laptop is ever stolen, I want to be able to track its location. The only problem is that for the location to be tracked, it has to be connected to the internet.

Sorry, I hate to post this, but I am stuck. I am taking over the administration of a doctors office, the previous IT guys don't know what the server passwords are, the only known passwords are user passwords and none have local login abilities. I dont know how this is possible, but to make it worse I am running in to issues blowing out the local administrator password also. I am using Offline NT password & Registry Editor, to remove the password, and I have used this software many times. Загрузочный диск Sonya LiveCD. Содержимое диска подобрано для системного администратора, однако обычному пользователю тоже принесет пользу. 
So a little back gound. I got an old computer with windows XP. There is only one account visible on the start up login screen. This is the account i am tying to get in. I have already tried Ophcrack(i think that was its name) and Offline NT Password & Registry editor. I did all the ISO burning and the steps in the programs fine each time. Since i didn't get a password using Ophcrack i tried the Offline NT Password & Registry editor and it said that i cleared the password PROBLEM: I have a Windows 7 VM running on VMware Player with one user on it without a password. For whatever reason, after I restarted my VM, it now has a password, and logging in with a blank password no longer works. ATTEMPTS AT FIXING: I've tried booting into Safe Mode in order to activate the Administrator account from the command line, but when I choose Safe Mode, it loads a few drivers and looks like it's going into Safe Mode, but it goes to a normal boot and I'm stuck My first story, and its just a quicky. I was asked to take 2 laptops off a domain for a client of mine. I did so. While I was triple-tasking, I forgot to set a local admin account on one of the laptops. And then I disjoined the laptop from the domain. The only local account was a non admin account. Luckily, MS embeds the hidden Administrator account in Windows - to which I didn't know the password to. Well, offline nt password & registry editor saved the day, i wiped the password Workbench 4-Port PS/2 IOGEAR KVM Switch 5-Port 10/100 Linksys Switch APC Back-UPS® XS 1000VA (4 Battery Outlets / 4 Surge Protector Outlets) iGO Slim Universal Laptop Power Adapter 17” Sanyo LCD Monitor Test Box (PC used to work with other PC’s) -Specifications --Windows XP Professional SP3 --2 GHz Pentium 4 Processor --768 MB DDR RAM --60 GB + 40 GB Hard Drives --PATA HDD Cage --SATA HDD Cage --DVD-SuperMulti Burner --eSATA Port --NETGEAR Wireless G Adapter.

Hi /r/Techsupport, I'm an idiot and accidentally locked myself out of my brother's computer (I'm staying at his house and he said I could game on it). I didn't know that you only get a certain number of pin log in attempts and when he texted me "you should be able to guess the pin" I tried a whole bunch of them. Now I only have his default windows local password to login with and he doesn't remember it somehow. Seriously, who doesn't remember their own passwords? Anyway, he's running window. I have a laptop that a friend asked me to remove the password. The original owner of the laptop passed away and they would like to be able to get into the laptop. It's a Dell Inspiron 13-7352. I've tried using Offline NT Password & Registry Editor but it won't boot the kernal completely. I've tried using Ophcrack but it couldn't find the tables. I've tried booting an install disk but the boot froze up. Any other suggestions, preferable free suggestions, that you might have would hello, to make a long story short, i've lost my new password that i set on my laptop. for this reason, i can't accurately give the specs. however, i do know that the one of the last things i did was update the system. so i know that the windows 8 software on there is as up to date as possible. the computer itself is an "HP ENVY dv6 Notebook PC". I could probably summon more information upon request but I don't believe it will be relevant. I have already attempted to use "Hiren's Specs: Dell XPS L421X, Windows 7 SP1 (I think). Contains 500GB Hitachi HTS545050A7E380 fixed HDD and 32GB Samsung PM830 mSATA drive. On Monday I was using my laptop as usual. On Tuesday I tried to log in to my account and found I could not. Tuesday was an extremely stressful morning, and so I assumed I had forgotten my password. Since then I have used Offline NT Password & Registry Editor to erase the account password, and this was confirmed by running Ophcrack twice (ran it once trying. I have a problem with a computer. It is running windows 7 and has lost it's "trust relationship" with the domain controller. Also, someone disabled the only local admin account. Anyone know of a good CD or USB (preferrably USB) that I could boot to and enable the admin account so that I can remove it and re-add it to the domain? (/solved) - Used Offline NT Password/Registry Editor within Hiren's BCD to enable the account. The other day my girlfriends dad brought me his laptop because it was acting weird and asked me to check it out. I performed a virus scan on it using AVG Rescue CD booted off a USB drive. It found roughly 50 or so virus's and I deleted them. Rebooted and it wouldn't boot and it tries to restore to a previous version but it can't. So I tell him it might be a bit and take it home. At home I used a Windows 7 install USB to try system restore and it tells me that it can't do it but when it restarted. I am trying to help my friend who was given a laptop when working for a church that has since disintegrated. It is an HP 4710s and is running windows 7 pro. The church no longer exists, and all the pastors got to keep their laptops, but my friend has no idea how to get access to the domain administrator password so he can maintain his laptop. It has been about a year and a half, and he is getting to the point where he is considering installing windows from scratch, but he doesn't Hey guys! I have one User Account on my computer and I am having a problem with a password constantly being set on it and I have no idea what it is. I used Windows Offline NT Password and Registry Editor from pogostick.net to CLEAR my password but nevertheless when I start back up I once again have a password. Anyone have any idea what I can do? I have Windows 7 and not really sure what else I should Okay . so my moms old PC finally had a stroke, and while looking around for a new "used" pc for her. (All she does is Facebook, and Youtube.) One of the girls from work said she had an old Acer aspire sitting in her basement collecting dust and that I could have it to give to my mom if I could please get the pictures and stuff off of it first. Problem is . it's password protected to get into Windows Vista. and we spent about 4 hours trying random passwords
