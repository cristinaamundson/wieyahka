Chapter Select (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/arceroth) ----- The first notes from the giant organ hidden within castle Prometheus made it clear that Pearce wasn’t about to hold back. Dirt shook and grasses swayed under the massive sound, drowning out even the voices of thousands of men. The legion formation visibly staggered under the music, their stomping loosing cohesion and strength, centurions tore up and down their lines screaming to get them back in time. Hal had to smirk.

Part of being impeccable is speaking plainly. I’m not good at it. Yet I have nothing to hide and I remember early in my days of letter-writing the nights away the philosophy I still hold onto because it’s honest and true. I do love you. Yet, I still fear despite all dissonance at war with synchronicity that I lost you. Silly me. It never helped how much I avoided my own mind, hoping you’d corner me with yours. I’m a StoicSouldier. A new day with a new approach I’d call ToodayzMediteddy.

For now they were using the emblem of Gordon’s Hope, the goblet of fire they’d come up with to go with the naming of Castle Prometheus, but the barons were, apparently, looking to design one specifically for the kingdom. For his part Hal knelt and allowed Croft, high priest of the guild, place a crown.

I sometimes hear HipHop fans in rap debates argue that Kendrick doesn't have many standout quotables or witty wordplay/entendres like the other GOATs (Jay-Z, Eminem, Biggie, etc.). So last month I started to compile a list of what I think are some impressive bars from Kendrick Lamar. Some are really clever; some are just impactful emotionally or poetical.

And this isn't supposed to be a pity post, just something I had to post tribute to. I lost one of my best friends who I met on a wrestling community board back in 2008 (crazy to think about how I knew him for that long), he was the guy at one point in my life I could talk about wrestling with.
